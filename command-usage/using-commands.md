# Using commands

## How do I find the commands?

All commands are listed in different pages corresponding towards their type. For example, all Reddit commands are in the page named "Reddit Commands".

### How Do I use commands?

Each page will tell you: what the command does, how to use it, what permissions you need, etc. Also the usage of them will be listed in a code block as shown below. 

```
m!<command> or m!<command> <@user|@role|#channel|etc> or m!<command> [@user|@role|#channel|etc].
```

You can also copy the usage to your clipboard too.
