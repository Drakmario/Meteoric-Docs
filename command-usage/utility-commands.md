  Utility commands are mainly used for seeing your's or the bot's ping, or to view the avatar of a user. None of these commands require both the bot nor author to have any certain role permissions, but this could change with new commands added for the utility category.

# Utility Commands

## Using Commands

### Hi

Have the bot respond "Hello" back to you

Usage:

```
m!hi
```

### Meteoric

Have a talk with the bot. This command uses an API package to help meteoric simulate a human. This is still underwork though so the things meteoric says can be off topic.

Usage:

```
m!meteoric [topic]
```

### Ping

Have the bot display the ping for both you and itself.

Usage:

```
m!ping
```

### Poll

Create a poll and send it to a channel using the bot. The bot will send the poll in a embed and will react to it with ✅ for yes and ❌ for no.

Usage:

```
m!poll <channel> <topic>
```

### Avatar

Displays your's or another user's avatar. Animated avatars are support with this command.

Usage:

```
m!avatar [@user]
```

### Servericon

See the icon of the server. Animated icons are support with this command.

Usage:

```
m!servericon
```
