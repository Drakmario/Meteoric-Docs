### Changed

* Meteoric's ChatBot - Meteoric's Chatbot system has been remade from a command into a event. Once you set a channel for Meteoric's chatbot api to be set to any message sent within that channel Meteoric will respond back.
* Slowmode - If this command is used in a channel with slowmode enable the the command has no args Meteoric will set the channel's slowmode to 0.
* Warn, mute, unmute, kick - Confirmation messages have not been changes. Also, these 3 commands are now logged unless a modlog channel has been set.
* Userinfo - Instead of Username for Account Info saying "Random Name#0000 | Bot: false/true" It's now say "Random Name#0000" and right after the discriminator it'll have either a bot tag or not depending on if the user is a bot or not. The command also displays the user's/bot's nickname for the server as well their Highest role, if they don't have a high role then it'll display "No roles".
* Report - Report Bug command now gives you a invite link to the support server so you can see the bug you submitted.

### Removed

* Document command - The reason I removed this command is because there's no need to have Meteoric's Docs exist in the form of a command.

### Fixed

* Under the hood fixes
* Fixed up the help menu a bit (Grammar and changed how stuff is worded)
