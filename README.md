## Introduction

Meteoric is an advanced **Reddit**, **Moderation**, and **multi-purpose** bot, this bot suits every members' needs for a great bot.  On top of that, the bot is completely free requiring no payments to use any of it's commands.

### Getting Setup

When [inviting](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=734974153630810245&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847) Meteoric, make sure you have **Manage Server** on the guild you're adding the bot so you can invite it.

After adding Meteoric to your server make sure you give him the permissions it asks for \(administrator, manage server, etc\) and make sure it's bot role \(unless a role is given to all bots on the server\) is above the member role/@everyone role, that way he can perform all tasks finely especially moderation commands.

Meteoric's prefix is m! by default. You can be configure this by running `m!setprefix <New Prefix>`. The new prefix cannot go over 5 characters.

If you're planning on using Meteoric for Moderation, I highly recommend setting a channel for modlogs. To do this run `m!setmodlogs <#channel>`, at the moment only warn, mute, unmute, and kick are logged but more mod commands will be able to get logged.
